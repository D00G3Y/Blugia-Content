Description: Pokemon Rom Hack Contributor Content Folder
Updated Last: 6/28/23

## Playthrough Instructions

### Begin
While playing a fan game, keep notes while you play about important aspects of the hack. Things like the pokedex, moves and abilities are not necessary to record unless they are like strawberry.

- Vanilla is like base game, ( e.g. think PKMN Emerald or Fire Red those are vanilla )
- Strawberry are additions like:
    - Outfits
    - Collectable Tokens
    - New Cities or areas
    - New Pokemon or abilities
    - Etc.

In theory each hack will have some differentiation from each other but lets always compare the flavor of the hack to the vanilla games. (There are multiple versions of Emerald for example that have maybe 2-5 permutations)

### Game Start

#### Character Names
Preferably name your character Blugia, to stay in theme with the site. If you prefer to use another moniker use one that isn't profane or derogatory and that you're okay with being public on the world wide web.

If you use the name Blugia for the character try and pick a color scheme if applicable that resembles Lugia's color palette. As far as I am aware Prism and Unbound are examples of hack that have outfit features.

PLEASE...Please...please name your rival if applicable any one of these 3 names:
- Serebii
- Smogon
- Bulbapedia or Bulba

I think this is funny, and I'm sure someone else will get a smirk out of it. If you come acropss any interactions with your rival try to remember to take a screenshot, we can use them in the game's index file a.k.a. summary page.

#### Starters and Pokemon
Feel free to choose whichever starter pokemon you want, but during the playthrough try to use pokemon that are specific to that game.

Example: If you are playing a version of Emerald that has Sun & Moon mons instead of the typical gen 3 casting, try to use more of those monsters so it shows the distinction in the game summary page.

#### Status Updates
Any time you do something in the game that feels notable take note of it. This could be beating a gym leader, finishing an event in the story or obtaining an essential key item or Hidden Machine. The more we document the more we can help new and confused players.

Feel free to post party updates in the discord. I love seeing party comps this isn't important to the website but its kinda like learning someone's fast food order.

## Folder Instructions

Right now I am using this API to render Content pages for the site.
    https://content.nuxtjs.org/

It uses Markdown files and renders them into html for our browsers. 

Its great at throwing content on a page, however I will have to eventually style it to be a bit more user friendly. This is on my radar but not on my priority list. 

The easy way to use and take notes is to open the content folder navigate to either Emerald, Fire Red
or Crystal (RPGXP on the way!) create a folder for the game you are going to collect info for and then write your summary notes in a file called index.md

    Example: content/firered/unbound/index.md
    **We can create other files later on for specific topics such as "in-game trade pokemon"** 

This structure will keep upload and verification times to a minimum, since I will be updating the sites current content folder with the one in this repo, and then updating the router paths for all new pages.

## Help & Questions
